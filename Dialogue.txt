The period is very close to an imperative development of literature.

From 1880s, the world is changing and moving by leaps and bounds,
and becoming restless and innovative due to World War I and the industrialization.

Many writers came up with creative minds responded to a wounded society.

Poets and writers experienced new forms that were different from traditional ones.

They expected the reader to engage thoughtfully with the work.(2:02)

Among all literatures, the development of poems played an important role.

The four authors contributed a lot during the period 
and published many representative products.


They are also main force in forming our library 
as they own both books written by themselves and others.
